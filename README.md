Tower Defense Lite Game
=======================

Created by Tomas Dardet
-----------------------

Python 3.4.0 game is *tower_defense.py*

Python 2.7.8 game is *tower_defense_python2.py* which also *requires* the **Pillow** imaging library.

You can obtain the Pillow imaging library in three steps:  
    1. open your terminal (cmd.exe on Windows)  
    2. change directory (cd) into the Scripts directory of your python27 installation. (In my case it is --- C:/Python27/Scripts)  
    3. run the following command on your terminal: pip install pillow  

Game controls are listed when the game begins.
